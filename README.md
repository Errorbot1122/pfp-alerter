    <summary><h5><small><em>*: More info about the logging<em></small></h5></summary>
    <p>This is for sending logs/log ids to users when an error occurs. This system should be robust so it can work for other bots <small><em>(maybe a separate module, idk).</em></small></p>
    <p>It would be nice if we where able to send the full log to the user, so they can send it as an issue and get well versed contributes to help, however, logs most likely will have context that contain sensitive data and also most people using the bot, are most-likely... <em>dumb</em> so it wouldn't be of use to most people</p>
